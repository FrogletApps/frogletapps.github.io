This project is a Twitter bot running on a Raspberry Pi Model B+ which can tweet random messages, sensor data, and also take selfies!  I admit it's almost completely useless, but it was pretty fun to make!  I don't tend to run it much any more, but it's up and tweeting away from time to time!  I also used this Pi to make the Pi Timelapse
