This is a project I've been building and improving for quite some time.  It was intially designed to be a webserver, however I decided to give it the ability to tweet vital data to me (eg the temperature).  I later also allowed it to tweet random messages, and also take selfies of itself with a Pi camera mounted on a lego selfie stick.  The webserver also has a control page for the Pi, where I can manually trigger tweets (it usually automatically tweets about once an hour otherwise). 

I've used this as a basis for other projects, such as the Tree Timelapse.
