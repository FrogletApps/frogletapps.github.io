This was created using a Raspberry Pi B+ with a pi camera, it was set up to take photos every 15 minutes from just before sunrise to just after sunset.

Photos taken were stored on the Pi and uploaded to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PiServer2015/status/791542516344434690), then compiled into the video below afterwards.
