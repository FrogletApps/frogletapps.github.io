This is an Arduino project designed to sit on Team ROUSE's desk at the VEX World Championships 2016! It can display random messages when the Arduino is moved, or play the UK National Anthem (with lyrics), and also the Portal 2 end theme (Want You Gone), because why not... A tiny part of the Portal 1 end theme (Still Alive) was also started but never finished as it wouldn't fit on the Arduino :(

When the Arduino turns on one of the three programs is selected by how many tilts the Arduino counts in the first 10 seconds of being on.
